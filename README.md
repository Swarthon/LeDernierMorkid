# Le Dernier Morkid

This is the official repository of Le Dernier Morkid, an open source role play game written in C++.
It aims to provide a full open source game which would be free.

Yet is this project under development, I only work on it on my spare time, therefore is its evolution a bit slow.

## Requirements

You will need a C++ compiler, see [Compiling](#compiling) section for more informations.  The project need the [OGRE library](http://ogre3d.org), which itself needs the [SDL2 library](http://libsdl.org/). To compile them, search on their website or use prebuilt files.

It has already been tested on Linux and Windows. I highly recommend to use the GNU Compiler (MinGW on Windows), with wich it has already been compiled.

## Compiling

To compile this code, you will need to run cmake. Use either `cmake-gui` or `cmake` to configure the project and then compile it. If you have trouble in doing it, just contact me, I will try to answer you as fast as possible, for more information see [Contacting](#contacting).

## Running

Once you compiled this program, move to the directory where you built it. Then run `LeDernierMorkid`.
