An open source and free role-\/playing game





\subsection*{Introduction}

This is the official repository of Le Dernier Morkid, an open source role-\/playing game written in C++. It aims to provide a full open source game which would be free.

Yet is this project under development, I only work on it on my spare time, therefore is its evolution a bit slow.

\subsection*{Requirements}

You will need a C++ compiler, see \href{#compiling}{\tt Compiling} section for more informations. The project need the \href{http://ogre3d.org}{\tt O\+G\+RE library}, which itself needs the \href{http://libsdl.org/}{\tt S\+D\+L2 library}. To compile them, search on their website or use prebuilt files.

It has already been tested on Linux and Windows. I highly recommend to use the G\+NU Compiler (Min\+GW on Windows), with wich it has already been compiled.

\subsection*{Dependencies}

As written below in \href{#requirement}{\tt Requirements}, this project has a few dependencies \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Ogre3D}, version 2.\+1, the components you need are Hlms\+Pbs and Hlms\+Unlit. The version 2.\+1 is not released yet but you can download it by doing {\ttfamily hg clone \href{https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre}{\tt https\+://bitbucket.\+org/sinbad/ogre} \&\& cd ogre/ \&\& hg pull \&\& hg update v2-\/1}, assuming you have Mercurial.
\item {\bfseries S\+D\+L2}, the library used by Ogre to get the input. This library is very common and you can download it either from you package manager either from \href{http://libsdl.org/}{\tt the official site}
\item {\bfseries C\+E\+G\+UI}, version 0.\+8, a library which provide Ogre3D support for G\+UI. The version 0.\+8, which is yet only doesn\textquotesingle{}t compile for Ogre 2.\+1, so I use a patch found \href{http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=82911&start=25}{\tt here}, which gives \href{https://pastebin.com/BB7CmUtw}{\tt this link}. To download the sources, the patch and apply it. {\ttfamily hg clone \href{https://bitbucket.org/cegui/cegui}{\tt https\+://bitbucket.\+org/cegui/cegui} \&\& cd cegui/ \&\& hg pull \&\& hg update v0-\/8 \&\& wget \href{https://pastebin.com/raw/BB7CmUtw}{\tt https\+://pastebin.\+com/raw/\+B\+B7\+Cm\+Utw} -\/O cegui.\+patch \&\& patch -\/p1 $<$ cegui.\+patch}, assuming you have Mercurial, wget and patch.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Compiling}

Before trying to compile the project itself, check if you have all the dependencies, see \href{#dependencies}{\tt Dependencies}. To compile this code, you will need to run cmake. Use either {\ttfamily cmake-\/gui} or {\ttfamily cmake} to configure the project and then compile it. If you have trouble in doing it, just contact me, I will try to answer you as fast as possible, for more information see \href{#contacting}{\tt Contacting}.

\subsection*{Running}

Once you compiled this program, move to the directory where you built it. Then run {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_le_dernier_morkid}{Le\+Dernier\+Morkid}}.

\subsection*{Bugs}

Remember that this project is under development and bugs may be frequent. If you discover one, post an issue. You can also try to repair it yourself. You can contact me too, see \href{#contacting}{\tt Contacting}
